Successful update of the source code for more HTML semantics, logical restructure of elements, addition of alt text attributes, sequential reordering of heading atrributes, and addition of a website title.

Much of this website's original code used many div class tags. I cleaned these up by using HTML semantics and consolidated the CSS code to apply to more tags at once to save space. This also made it easier to read. I also added alt text to all of the website's images which should help with accessibility and therefore SEO. Finally, I went through and organized and consolidated the code further to try to clean it up a bit more!

Here is a screenshot of my new version of the website:
